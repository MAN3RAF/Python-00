# Python-00 🌱


A collection of beginner-friendly Python exercises with a gardening and farming theme. This project is designed to help newcomers learn Python fundamentals through practical, thematic examples.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains 8 exercises (ex0-ex7) that progressively introduce core Python concepts including:

- Basic output and input handling
- Variables and data types
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements
- Loops (iterative and recursive)
- Functions with type hints
- String formatting

## 🌾 Exercises

### ex0: Hello Garden
**File:** `ft_hello_garden.py`
- **Concept:** Basic print statement
- **Description:** A simple "Hello World" style program introducing the gardening theme

### ex1: Plot Area Calculator
**File:** `ft_plot_area.py`
- **Concept:** User input, variables, arithmetic operations
- **Description:** Calculates the area of a garden plot based on length and width

### ex2: Harvest Total
**File:** `ft_harvest_total.py`
- **Concept:** Multiple inputs, variable accumulation
- **Description:** Sums up harvest quantities over 3 days

### ex3: Plant Age Checker
**File:** `ft_plant_age.py`
- **Concept:** Conditional statements (if/else)
- **Description:** Determines if a plant is ready to harvest based on age (60+ days)

### ex4: Water Reminder
**File:** `ft_water_reminder.py`
- **Concept:** Conditional logic
- **Description:** Reminds you to water plants if it's been 2+ days since last watering

### ex5: Harvest Countdown
**Files:** 
- `ft_count_harvest_iterative.py` - Loop-based approach
- `ft_count_harvest_recursive.py` - Recursive approach

- **Concept:** Iteration vs. Recursion
- **Description:** Counts down days until harvest time using both iterative and recursive methods

### ex6: Garden Summary
**File:** `ft_garden_summary.py`
- **Concept:** String manipulation, formatted output
- **Description:** Displays a summary report for a garden including name and plant count

### ex7: Seed Inventory
**File:** `ft_seed_inventory.py`
- **Concept:** Function parameters, type hints, conditional logic
- **Description:** Manages seed inventory with different unit types (packets, grams, area)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the Exercises

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAN3RAF/Python-00.git
cd Python-00
```

2. Navigate to any exercise directory:
```bash
cd ex0
```

3. Run the Python file:
```bash
python ft_hello_garden.py
```

Or import and call the function:
```python
from ex0.ft_hello_garden import ft_hello_garden
ft_hello_garden()
```

## 🎯 Learning Path

The exercises are designed to be completed in order (ex0 → ex7), with each building upon concepts from previous exercises:

1. **ex0-ex2:** Basic I/O and arithmetic
2. **ex3-ex4:** Decision making with conditionals
3. **ex5:** Understanding loops and recursion
4. **ex6:** Working with strings
5. **ex7:** Advanced functions with type hints

## 🌟 Features

- **Thematic Learning:** All exercises use a consistent gardening/farming theme
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Exercises gradually increase in complexity
- **Practical Examples:** Real-world scenarios make concepts easier to understand
- **Clean Code:** Simple, readable code suitable for beginners
